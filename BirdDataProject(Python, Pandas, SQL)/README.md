NOTICE: To run the project currently, folders named 'CSVs' and 'DBs' must be manually added to the 'ProjectFiles' before opening the main app. 

To use, simply upload your ebird data download file under the 'ProjectFiles' folder and then run the 'polkdata_main.py' file. In the near future compatability will be added for all Oregon counties and the state itself.
