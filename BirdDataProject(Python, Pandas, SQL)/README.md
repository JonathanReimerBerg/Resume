## OVERVIEW:
Tech Used: Python (with many libraries, most notable pandas) and SQL

This is a simple app that with just a single eBird data download (CSV file) can generate many different personal peices of data that may not be given in eBird. Some examples of current features are the ability to see yearly high counts and specific species charts. Currently the project is only compatible for Polk County Oregon, but soon there will be added compatability for the entire state of Oregon and all of its counties, and possibly generalization for any region. 

## HOW TO RUN
To use, simply upload your ebird data download file under the 'ProjectFiles' folder and then run the 'polkdata_main.py' file. In the near future compatability will be added for all Oregon counties and the state itself.
